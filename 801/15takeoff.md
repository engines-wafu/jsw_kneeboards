CAUTION
-------
Uncommanded nosewheel steering angle excursions may occur if after lift--off an immediate turn is made. With lift--off above 100 KGS, the nosewheel may cant to such a degree that undesirable ground handling characteristics may occur on touch down. Extending upwind for approximately 10 to 15 seconds while rotational speed slows down can minimize this gyroscopic effect.
