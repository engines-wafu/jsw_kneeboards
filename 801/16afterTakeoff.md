## Takeoff

### Conventional

Landing Gear | `Up`
Flaps | `Auto`

Selection of AUTO flaps shall be made when comfortably airborne at no less than 25째 nozzle angle.

---- | --------
Nozzles | `Aft`
Water | `Off`
STO Stop | `Clear`

CAUTION
-------
After takeoff, do not apply wheel brakes prior to, or as part of raising the landing gear. Applying wheel brakes immediately after takeoff while the wheels are spinning places undue stress on the main landing gear system and may cause the main landing gear door to be pulled into the main wheel well. If the main landing gear doors are jammed, the main landing gear will not extend when the landing gear handle is lowered resulting in a main landing gear up landing.

Note
----
With the landing gear up, the JPT limiters will throttle the engine back to the maximum thrust rating when nozzle angle is reduced below 7째 to 12째.  If operating near lift ratings (particularly on a wet takeoff), this sudden and large thrust reduction must be anticipated or the last 20째 of nozzle rotation delayed until after power has been reduced with the throttle.
